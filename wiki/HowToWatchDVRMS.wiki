#summary How to watch .dvr-ms with PS3 Media Server

= Introduction =

PS3 Media Server uses an updated version of FFmpeg who is unfortunately not quite compatible for playing .dvr-ms files. That's why PS3 Media Server offers a package with a special version of FFmpeg who can plays dvr-ms (but without replace the official updated one, who is useful for other filetypes)

= Details =

1. First, you need to download this package: 

http://ps3mediaserver.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ps3mediaserver/dist-archive/pms-win32-dvrms-addon.zip

2. Then you have to unzip this archive into the PMS application folder (your archiver should ask you to replace/add some files to the win32 folder)

3. Restart PMS and it should be fine. You can verify it with checking the DVR-MS remux engine options: the alternative path should automatically point to the ffmpeg_MPGMUX executable

= Annexes =

The DVR-MS ffmpeg package is originally from here:
